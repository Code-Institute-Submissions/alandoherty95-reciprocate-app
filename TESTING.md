## 1. Overview

**Consistent design**

This website was designed to remain consistent wherever possible across the various pages:

- The Navigation Bar and Footer are the same on all pages, including both error handling pages.

- All headings are clear and concise with additional info below.

- Recipe cards follow a uniform size and structure.

- Buttons are standardised throughout the website using either small or large buttons with varying colours depending on the actions.

**Easy navigation**

Designing a platform with easy navigation was front of mind during the development of this project:

- The Navigation Bar and Footer contain links for easily navigating to other pages.

- Headings are clear and descriptive of the content displayed below.

- When a search finds no results, the user is prompted to try different search words.

- Most views or actions can be reached within four clicks or taps.

**Visually appealing**

- Recipe cards focus on the images uploaded by users.

- Striking images encourage users to find out more info about the recipes.

- Bright colours used for headings grabs the attention of the user.

**Intuitive design**

- In the Navigation Bar, the Reciprocate logo returns users to the homepage displaying all recipes.

- Familiar icons are used throughout the website for typical actions e.g. delete, search.

- Flash messages notify users on screen when they perform meaningful actions e.g. sharing a new recipe or logging in.

- A modal pops up to confirm deletion of recipes or categories of recipe.

- A modal reveals more info about how to upload an image if the icon is clicked while filling out form.

**Responsiveness**

- All pages respond to a variety of different screen sizes with help from the Materialize elements.

- Different sized screens were tested extensively using [Chrome Dev Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/).

- I added the`loading="lazy"`attribute to recipe images to keep loading time down as the number of images on the website increases.

**Security**

- Passwords are hashed using Werkzeug Security to ensure they are not visible to the owner of the database or anyone else.
- Users can create a secure password of between 4 and 30 characters when creating their account. Both numbers and letters can be used.

## 4. Automated Testing

![Desktop Report]()

![Mobile Report]()

<span id="version-control"></span>

### Lighthouse Opportunities

- Properly size images: Serve images that are appropriately-sized to save cellular data and improve load time

- Defer offscreen images: Consider lazy-loading offscreen and hidden images after all critical resources have finished loading to lower time to interactive.

- Eliminate render-blocking resources: Resources are blocking the first paint of your page. Consider delivering critical JS/CSS inline and deferring all non-critical JS/styles.

- Remove unused JavaScript: Remove unused JavaScript to reduce bytes consumed by network activity

- Remove unused CSS: Remove dead rules from stylesheets and defer the loading of CSS not used for above-the-fold content to reduce unnecessary bytes consumed by network activity

- Image elements do not have explicit `width` and `height`

- Set an explicit width and height on image elements to reduce layout shifts and improve CLS.

- Displays images with incorrect aspect ratio: Image display dimensions should match natural aspect ratio.

- Document does not have a meta description: Meta descriptions may be included in search results to concisely summarise page content.

## 5. Version Control

Throughout the production of this application, I used [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/) as a local repository and [GitHub](https://github.com/) as a remote repository.

-- **Creating a Repository** --

1. Create a repository in GitHub by clicking 'New repository' in the top right corner of the main page.

2. Select the Code Institute Template from drop-down options, enter the repository name (and description).

3. Select 'Public' and then click 'Create Repository'.

4. Open the repository on Git Pod.

â€” **Commits** â€” Commits were made frequently and consistently throughout the course of this project. It is important to commit often to ensure no work is lost during production. The work is saved securely in GitHub.

- **git status** checks the current status of new or modified files and folders

- **git add - A** adds files to the staging area before committing.

- **git commit -m "commit description"** commits the work on the stage before pushing it to GitHub.

- **git push** updates the repository in GitHub to include new or modified files and folders.

<span id="deployment"></span>

## 6. Deployment

The application was deployed using [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). Heroku is a cloud platform with a service supporting several programming languages including Python. GitHub can host static websites but this particular project requires back-end technology such as a server and a database. I connected the GitHub repository with Heroku.

Before deploying the website to Heroku, please follow the necessary steps outlined below:

1. Create a `requirements.txt` file containing the name of packages being used in Python. The file is updated whenever new packages or modules are installed during the project.

2. Create a `Procfile` containing the name of the application file. Procfile may have a blank line when it is created so remove it as it may cause problems

3. Push the two files above to GitHub to save.

Once those steps are done, the website can be deployed and below are the steps of the deployment in Heroku.

1. Create an account in Heroku.

2. Click 'New' and then 'Create new app' to get started.

3. Enter a unique 'App name' and 'Choose a region'. Then click 'Create app'.

4. Navigate to the 'Deploy' tab and click 'Connect to Github'.

5. Search for the name of the repository and click 'Connect'.

6. Navigate to the 'Settings' tab, click 'Reveal Config Vars' and enter the necessary keys and values.

7. Navigate back to the 'Deploy' tab and click 'Enable Automatic Deploys'

8. Click 'Deploy Branch'.

9. A message will appear saying 'Your app was successfully deployed.'

10. Click 'View'.

## 7. Resolved Bugs

- Deletion modal was not functioning, the modal used for confirming an action before deleting was not popping up and the selection was deleted without confirmation: the class `modal-trigger` was added to the modal function to trigger to pop up window before deleting the record.

- Background and foreground colours do not have a sufficient contrast ratio. Low-contrast text is difficult or impossible for many users to read: Colour scheme was altered to be more visually pleasing.

- Favicon not displaying: graphic image displayed correctly after changing the file path. Favicon is visible on desktop and mobile devices.

- Form fields not populating when editing a recipe, the existing information was not displayed in each of the fields to allow editing: tweaked input to `value="{{ recipe.recipe_name }}"`. The fields are populating automatically now based on the `recipe_id`.

- Search feature was functioning but it did not display the search words that were inputted after submitting. The `{page_heading}` variable was added to display the missing information. e.g. `"Showing results for: banana"`

- Search feature was displaying results based on the `recipe_name` and `recipe_ingredients`. The `category_name` was added to the index to ensure these results were also returned.

- The recipe images did not fit well within the card. The `-o-object-fit: contain;`styling was added so the image will keep its aspect ratio, but is resized to fit within the given dimension.

- The homepage was loading slowly due to the large number of images. I changed the number of recipes displayed per page from 9 to 6 using pagination. This improved the loading speed of the site and gave more attention to the 6 recipes displayed on each tab.

- Lighthouse identified buttons with an icon but no label and advised using the `aria-label` attribute. This attribute is used to provide the label to any assistive technologies.

- The drop-down field in the add recipe form changed colour back to red after selecting next field. The colour was corrected to green in the JS code and resolved this minor issue.

- Added `input type="url"` to the add recipe form to allow users to input the full image url when sharing a recipe. The image will be displayed on the recipe card.

<span id="unresolved"></span>

## 8. Unresolved Bugs

- Materialize select dropdown does not function correctly on iOS: known bug with Materialize meaning either the dropdown does not appear or selects the wrong item when tapped/clicked. I read more information about this possible bug on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52850091/materialize-select-and-dropdown-touch-event-selecting-wrong-item)

- Warning reported by Chrome console, `[DOM] Input elements should have autocomplete attributes`: Resolution: added `autocomplete` to Register and Log In inputs.

**Issues reported by GitPod**

Special characters must be escaped : [ > ] [Jinja documentation](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/templates/#escaping) suggested escaping the `>` character, this warning persists in the console.

Doctype must be declared first: This issue relates to GitPod's inability to recognise the `!DOCTYPE html` in the base.html, is being passed through to all other HTML templates.
