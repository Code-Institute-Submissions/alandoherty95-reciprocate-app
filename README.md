# Reciprocate

Welcome to **Reciprocate**! 

**Reciprocate** is a community-based website designed to allow users to share and contribute recipes ideas with each other. Users utilise the website to share their own data with the community, and benefit from having convenient access to the data provided by all other members. 

In preparation for this project, I conducted research on friends, colleagues and family members to identify the kind of recipes in demand. The three main recipes types we are focusing on are smoothies, cocktails and snacks. The most popular recipes will be compiled in a cookbook which can be published.

## User Experience (UX)

The website was designed with a community-based approach in mind. It was created with three main objectives in mind:

-   To encourage people to share their favourite recipes with all other members
    
-   To allow convenient access to the recipes provided by all other members
    
-   To compiled the most popular recipes in a cookbook for publishing
    

As mentioned, 

**Smoothies:** are becoming more popular each year. Many people are opting for smoothies made up of fruit and vegetables as part of their daily intake. Our smoothie recipes provides users with choice while keeping up a healthy diet.

**Cocktails:** are also becoming increasingly popular among adults. People have grown to appreciate the variety of taste and beauty of these artisan drinks. Our cocktail recipes allows users to create popular drinks themselves without having to rely solely on bartenders.

**Snacks:** have also been a significant part of our diet. People have become more creative and adventurous with their snacking habits in recent years. Our snack recipes offer choice for people constantly on-the-go.
